# MPI laboratory

## Theory
The goal of this program is to solve differential equation:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{\partial u(t, x)}{\partial t} + a \cdot \frac{\partial u(t, x)}{\partial x} = f(t,x)">
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=u(0,x) = \varphi (x), 0 <= x <= X">
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=u(t,o) = \psi (t), 0 <= t <= T">

Function u(t,x) is considered in:
img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=t = k\tau, 0 <= k <= K">
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x = mh, 0 <= m <= M">
